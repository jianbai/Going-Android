    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_1">So then who is this app for?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_1">Going is for people who want to meet people. If (a) you like meeting new people and (b) you\'re free this weekend, then Going is for you!</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_2">How do matches work?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_2">Matches are groups of 4 people that are free to hang out this weekend. Matches are made based on age and gender preferences.</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_3">Why do matches only last for the weekend?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_3">Matches disappear every week so you can make new matches and meet more people.</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_4">How do I add friends?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_4">When your matches disappear, you\'ll be prompted to choose who you want to keep as friends.</string>

    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_question_0">Why groups of 4?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_answer_0">Because 4 is a magical number.</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_question_1">Why can’t I choose my matches?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_answer_1">Going is a place where unlikely friendships are made. You set your preferences based on age and gender, and chance takes care of the rest!</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_question_2">Who are you people? Why are you doing this?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_answer_2">We are concerned citizens who miss the times when you didn\'t need an excuse to hang out with strangers and make new friends. So we imagined a big orange button that summoned new people and made it into this app.</string>
