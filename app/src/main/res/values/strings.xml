    <string name="login_tutorial_3">We don’t use any photos, and we don’t post anything to Facebook.\n\nWe ask for your birthday and hometown to fill out your profile.\n\nWe use location services and Facebook login to make sure you get matched with real people around you.\n\nFinally, Go is for people who want to meet people, so we ask for your friends who use the app so you don’t get matched with people you already know!</string>

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_title">FAQs</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_0">Is this a dating app?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_0">No! Go is not a place for finding dates, hookups, flings, trysts, affairs, and/or dalliances.</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_1">So then who is this app for?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_1">Go is for people who want to meet people. Real life people, right here in Vancouver. If (i) you like meeting new people and (ii) you’re free this weekend, then Go is for you!</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_2">How do matches work?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_2">Matches are groups of 4 people that are free this weekend. If you’re free, press the big shiny “Go” button and Go will match you with 3 other people around you. You can then chat with each other in the app. Make plans to go somewhere cool! Matches only last for one weekend.</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_3">Why do matches only last for the weekend?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_3">Matches disappear every week so you can make new matches and meet more awesome people. So quit dwelling on the past! Go looks forward, not backward; upward not forward; and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards next weekend!</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_question_4">How do I add friends?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_faq_answer_4">After you meet, Go leaves it up to you to decide who to keep in touch with. When your match disappears, you’ll be prompted to choose who you want to keep as friends. Keep using Go to meet more people and grow your friends list.</string>
    <!-- RAQ -->
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_title">RAQs</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_question_0">Why groups of 4?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_answer_0">4 is the magic number! 3 and 5 are graceless odd numbers, and 6 is too many. Nothing quite like a great crew of 4.</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_question_1">Why can’t I choose my matches?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_answer_1">Go isn’t about choosing who to make friends with based on what they look like. It’s also not about making you assemble and maintain a ‘profile’ that you think others will find attractive. That’s why Go profiles are minimal and have no photos. Go is a place where everyone is welcome, no one is judged, and unlikely friendships are made.</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_question_2">Who are you people? Why are you doing this?</string>
    <string name="settings_dialog_raq_answer_2">When we were little we had the school yard. In college we had the dorm. Now we’re all grown up and we don’t have an excuse anymore to just hang out and make new friends. Well, that sucks. We want an easy way to meet new people in the city. People who are just like us. People who are really different. All kinds of people. People who want to meet people.</string>
